Color Palette of the Internet
===

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/kiernanmcgowan/webcolor.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A visualization of the color palettes used by popular sites on the internet.

Inspired by [Wired's June 2008 cover](http://hint.fm/projects/wired2008/)

Colors
====

A screen shot of each website was taken using `gnome-web-photo` and the most 5 prominent colors are selected using `imagemagick`. Each website has a generated image that is drawn based on the prevalence of each of these colors.

The background of each square is the most common color from the snapshot of a given site. The target in the middle shows the remaining four colors. Each color on the target has an area that is proportional to the area taken up in the sample screen shot.

Sample Images
===

Anyone interested in the sample images can find them at `http://s3.amazonaws.com/dropdownmenu-color-img/` followed by the hostname (i.e. `http://s3.amazonaws.com/dropdownmenu-color-img/amazon`)

Be careful there is _no filter_ on the scraper and there is a lot of porn on the internet.
